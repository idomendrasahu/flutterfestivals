# flutterfestivals

In our everyday lives, we see amazing apps and often wonder how they are built. And for aspiring developers, the process can be quite overwhelming. The flutter festival aimed to bridge the gap between amateur developers and industry-ready apps. 

Flutter uses a variety of widgets to deliver a fully functioning application. It is everything a developer could ask for. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. 

Flutter Framework:- 

•Language: Flutter apps are written in Dart Language. 

•Flutter Engine: The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting Flutter applications, which is primarily written in C++. 

• Foundation Library: It provides basic classes and functions that are used to construct applications using Flutter, it is primarily written in Dart. 

• Design-Specific Widgets: It contains two sets of widgets. The first implements Google's Design Language, and the second implements the iOS Human interface guidelines. 

Why we adore Flutter? 

Flutter's features that let us rely on a single codebase and UI engine for cross-platform development make the task of creating versions of Android and iOS apps effortless. 

Flutter's widget library is fully packed with predefined functionality which reduces the overall coding time which is the most attractive trait of Flutter, as  there is no such thing as "time" in the Developer's life. 

Some of our most loved apps such as Google Ads, Xianyu by Alibaba, Postmuse, KlasterMe and many others are made using... Yes, you are right, all of them are made using Flutter. 

Learning Flutter and Flutter related concepts and getting the training by facilitators who directly learnt Flutter from Google Engineers was indeed a worthwhile experience. The attendees got a chance to build a real-life working app for your college, community or surroundings.
